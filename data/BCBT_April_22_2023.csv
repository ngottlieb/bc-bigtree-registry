The tree appears to be in good health with a nearly symmetrical radial crown. There is what appears to be a small 15-20cm diameter secondary trunk originating near the base of the tree that has self-grafted to the vastly larger main trunk. It has been completely incorporated intomthe main stem and cannot be differentiated beyind the 8-10m height on the mainstem. I would consider it to be an integral part of the tree.

3. km 1.4 - turn right at fork and continue for 1.4 km
4. km 2.7 - cross Deering Bridge and turn left onto the Gordon River Main (right goes to Lake Cowichan)
5. Stay on the mostly-paved Gordon River Main and after
approximately 5 km it will become gravel and you
will hit a “Y” where you go LEFT and cross a high bridge
over the beautiful Gordon River.
6. After crossing the bridge keep on the Gordon River Main
for about 1.5 km, staying to the RIGHT at the next “Y”.
7. Shortly after you will cross a small bridge over a creek
(Baird Creek). This is the Avatar Grove, the newly popular old-growth forest hiking area!
8. Continue past the Avatar Grove on the Gordon River Main
for approximately 4.5 km and take your FIRST RIGHT onto
Edinburgh Main road. (Note: it’s a smaller looking road)
9. You will soon cross over a bridge above a very tall canyon
on the Gordon River. *Note: From here on 4x4 vehicles with
good clearance are recommended!
10. Follow the rough road as it veers uphill and then right. Continue
on the main road for approximately 5 minutes.
11. A giant clearcut from 2012 will appear on your right hand
side. In that clearcut you will see two big Douglas-firs left
standing - the second one is Big Lonely Doug.

continuing all the way past the lake on Cowichan Main and eventually following the Nitinat River.
Turn right at T-Intersection ( 48.8627379, -124.6438995 ) over the bridge which crosses Nitinat River, following
Carmanah Main. A visit to the waterfalls on the Little Nitinat Falls is recommended for a quick break (unmarked pull
off near 48.871476, -124.687404 ).
Follow Carmanah Main until a bridge on your left crosses the Little Nitinat River onto Flora Main ( 48.8994754,
-124.6887141 ).
Follow Flora until you reach Upper Klanawa Main ( 48.861963, -124.739748 ) and turn left.
Not long after passing Newstead Main (do not take this road), the road starts climbing and splits. Take the left spur
K-265, up a steep pitch and around a tight bend ( 48.8267934, -124.7812745 ). After some time, along the South side
of K-265 there are a couple of small lakes accessed via a short spur (approx 48.8274633, -1248130282 ), where one
can visit the Fairy Bell Cedar at Dorothy Lake (at the head of the second lake, 48.825688, -124.822826 ).
Coming to another T-Intersection ( 48.8307925, -124.8372049 ), turn left and continue straight past another
intersection and follow it until you reach the spruce flats and recently logged areas at the bottom of the valley (approx
48.7969942, -124.8668236 ). This is where the Main and East Forks of the Klanawa River meet. This new road
bends East and becomes very coarse. It is advised that one parks in a safe location and walks to the Bumblebee
Tree from the road (starting at 48.801119, -124.832387 ).
*Alternatively the Hummingbird and adjacent forest stands can be reached by crossing one of the numerous log-jams
on the Klanawa River East Fork. Park on Newstead Main , and find a log-jam that you can cross safely ( 48.799488,
-124.817626 ) or ( 48.802287, -124.808875 ) for example. Be sensible, do not attempt when the river is flowing high,
and no I am not responsible if your shoe soles are slippery and your iphone goes for a swim ;) Keep your electronics
safe in a ziplock or wet bag. Personally, we prefer using Newstead Main, the road is in better condition and it is a
more straightforward route.

Lake. Arrive at a signposted split between Bamfield and Nitinat and head left towards Nitinat. Driving past the head
of the Lake, you eventually enter the Nitinat River Valley. At the entrance of Nitinat River Ecological Preserve
(Eastern Portion 48.901189, -124.545689 ) you will encounter old-growth Douglas fir forest and some roadside
CMT’s. Have a look at the impressive Nitinat Fir (just below the road, 48.893787, -124.556285 ).
It is also worth checking out the canyon section of the Nitinat river ( 48.895723, -124.558131 ).
A couple of hundred meters past the turnoff for Granite Main, find a safe place to park. On foot, follow an old spur on
the north side of the road ( 48.876268, -124.587473 ) briefly. When the spur becomes overgrown, head left
( 48.878611, -124.585422 ) through the bush. Heading slightly downhill, start contouring to your right along the hillside
until you encounter an impressive stand of Fir and Hemlock on the slope above the river. Here you will encounter the
Cauliflower Mushroom Fir. Follow the lower slope around a corner (northward and upstream) for 50m or so, staying
above the dense brush along the river edge. Once you can easily cross onto the river flats, find your way to the river
edge and safely fjord across the river, just above the bend. You should be able to see a large spruce and you may be
able to see 3PP’s double leaders a little further back from the shore. The tree is located on the flats about 60m from
shore amongst sword ferns.

the river when the flow is low, it is recommended to have your electronics in watertight bags and please be careful.","Gradually tapering and with a distinctive burl, the trunk splits into two healthy looking upward facing
leaders at approximately the 40m mark.
Located on a flat and sandy riparian floodplain, 3PP is a fine Douglas fir standing amidst Bigleaf
Maple, Hemlock and Sitka spruce about 60m from the bank of the Nitinat River.
This floodplain is part of a series of high quality, intact riverside patches of old growth standing
between the Eastern and Western portions of the Nitinat River Ecological Reserves. Sitka Spruce begin to
Reach full potential in the floodplains and Douglas fir become less abundant at river level. Here and across
the river in Macoola Grove, one will find the Red Listed Tooth- leaved Monkey flowers and Blue Listed
Scouler’s corydalis carpeting the floor during the late spring and summer.

Trail access is open all summer. Winter access is restricted to clients.  From Fernie, on Highway #3 turn onto Mount Fernie Park Road, proceed through campground to the Island Lake parking lot (gate is sometimes closed so inquire about vehicle accessibility). If able to drive to the lodge, drive the 8 km through spectacular old growth cedar forest, then follow the Fir Trail and look for the large western larch on the crest. From this vantage point, peering down into the deep gully this very stately tree is visible, but very difficult to access. Alternatively, book yourself a cat skiing adventure, and ask to be taken to Hunter Bowl, where the snowcat pick up zone is located very close to the tree.","This remarkable tree stands alone in an alder slide path, where evidence of seepage on the adjacent southerly facing slope was observed, as there was no snow on this slope. There are many very large trees on the crest above this Engelmann spruce, including western larch, Douglas fir, and some other mature spruce.
The tree appears to be in good health, as a 400 mm increment bore core sample was extracted with no signs of internal decay. The tree supports a healthy crown, and given its sheltered location, will hopefully extend its longevity for a while yet. Age is estimated at 550 years old.
Summer access would be very difficult as a waterfall is directly below, an alder choked gully above, and very thick vegetation surrounding the tree. Access at the time of measurement was via snowmobile.

bends East and becomes very coarse. It is advised that one parks in a safe location and walks into Hummingbird
Grove (starting at 48.801119, -124.832387 ).
Please be advised that this is an ACTIVE logging area, follow suitably safe driving techniques and be vigilant and
courteous to other road users. It is advised to only visit this area on weekends when logging activities are minimal.
This is a remote area without cellular reception so plan your trip accordingly. Input your coordinates before you leave
home. In general the gravel road driving is reasonable for most vehicles, but fill your tank and definitely bring a full
sized spare tire along for this trip.","CWHvh1 07. Hummingbird Tree has large buttressing roots, numerous large burls, a bare crown and a healthy canopy.

The trail is accessed by an old road on the south side of Highway 16, 1/2km before the Goat River bridge and rest area. The old road is easily missed by those driving on Highway 16, because of the steep drop it takes off the highway. If you do not have a 4-WD vehicle, it is best to park at the Goat River rest area and walk west on the south side of Highway 16 to spot the rough access road. If you drive down the old road, there is a small clearing a short ways down with room to park.The hike initially follows the old road. You will cross a rough wooden bridge over a creek. Shortly afterwards, you will reach a fork in the road where the right side is very overgrown. Take the left fork. A short distance after this, there is a second fork in the road, where an ATV trail continues to the right and the left side appears less worn-in. At this second fork, follow the left (less worn-in) side. After a minute or so, take the trail on the left leading away from the old road and into the forest (it should be flagged). From here, the trail is easy to follow. You will stay on the plateau before crossing a stream and descending towards the canyon.

Follow Carmanah Main until a bridge on your left crosses the Little Nitinat River onto Flora Main ( 48.8994754,

Take the left spur K-265, up a steep pitch and around a tight bend ( 48.8267934, -124.7812745 ).
After some time, along the South side of K-265 there are a couple of small lakes accessed via a short spur (approx

more westward lake, 48.825688, -124.822826 ).
Please be advised that this is an ACTIVE logging area, follow suitably safe driving techniques and be vigilant and
courteous to other road users. It is advised to only visit this area on weekends when logging activities are minimal.
This is a remote area without cellular reception so plan your trip accordingly. Input your coordinates before you leave
home. In general the gravel road driving is reasonable for most vehicles, but fill your tank and definitely bring a full
sized spare tire along for this trip.","- The Fairy Bell Cedar appears healthy, shows typical conical form and has two main leaders which are bare
at the tip and a smaller third leader.
-The Tree is located on a flat drainage area which flows to the head of nearby Dorothy Lake, at the edge of
a recent Cutblock between this and another small lake. These lakes drain into the Klanawa River,
1 km to the west. A fine old Sitka spruce tree stands about 50m to the South West of Fairy Bell.
-Although currently this area has been and is still being aggressively logged, numerous fine and large
specimens of Sitka spruce, Western Red cedar and even occasional Douglas fir still stand in the Klanawa

Turn left on Highway 16 and drive southeast for 8.9 km towards the Goat River bridge.

From the rest area, follow instructions for ""Goat River Canyon Trail"" on Trailpeak.                  the Goat River Rest Area. From the rest area, follow instructions for ""Goat River Canyon Trail"" on Trailpeak. 

The trail is accessed by an old road on the south side of Highway 16, 1/2km before the Goat River bridge and rest area. The old road is easily missed by those driving on Highway 16, because of the steep drop it takes off the highway. If you do not have a 4-WD vehicle, it is best to park at the Goat River rest area and walk west on the south side of Highway 16 to spot the rough access road. If you drive down the old road, there is a small clearing a short ways down with room to park.The hike initially follows the old road. You will cross a rough wooden bridge over a creek. Shortly afterwards, you will reach a fork in the road where the right side is very overgrown. Take the left fork. A short distance after this, there is a second fork in the road, where an ATV trail continues to the right and the left side appears less worn-in. At this second fork, follow the left (less worn-in) side. After a minute or so, take the trail on the left leading away from the old road and into the forest (it should be flagged). From here, the trail is easy to follow. You will stay on the plateau before crossing a stream and descending towards the canyon. After the stream is where the very old trees are located.GPS Coordinates:- Old road off Highway 16: 53.4924063, -120.6176087- Goat River Canyon (trail end point, for reference, to ensure one is hiking in the correct direction): 53.4772961, -120.6406700.

To access the site requires a 1 hour float plane ride from Burns Lake BC, followed by a 1 hour power boat trip to the north end of Tesla lake. This site required a 1 km hike from the shore of the lake. ","This whitebark pine was living and had no signs of blister rust, ips, blue stain fungus or mountain pine beetle present. It was a single stem and dominant in the canopy with 5-6 other whitebark pine trees in good health. A bear was using the base of one of the trees as a wallow and a squirrel midden were also present in this dominant cohort. It was situated in a productive toe slope near a riparian area in a cool and moist site with strong coastal influences. Four increment cores were taken with a haglof borer to determine the age of the tree. The 24 inch increment borer was not long enough to obtain the exact age of the tree. The minimum age of the tree (as determined through tree ring measurements of the four samples) is 459 years (1561-2020). Pith estimates could not be used to estimate the location of the centre of the tree as no ring curvature was present. The absence of ring curvature, DBH of the tree, and calculation of years to reach coring height suggest that this tree is between 600-800 years in age.
