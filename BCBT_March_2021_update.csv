3. km 1.4 - turn right at fork and continue for 1.4 km
4. km 2.7 - cross Deering Bridge and turn left onto the Gordon River Main (right goes to Lake Cowichan)
5. Stay on the mostly-paved Gordon River Main and after
approximately 5 km it will become gravel and you
will hit a “Y” where you go LEFT and cross a high bridge
over the beautiful Gordon River.
6. After crossing the bridge keep on the Gordon River Main
for about 1.5 km, staying to the RIGHT at the next “Y”.
7. Shortly after you will cross a small bridge over a creek
(Baird Creek). This is the Avatar Grove, the newly popular old-growth forest hiking area!
8. Continue past the Avatar Grove on the Gordon River Main
for approximately 4.5 km and take your FIRST RIGHT onto

side. In that clearcut you will see two big Douglas-firs left
standing - the second one is Big Lonely Doug.

If interested in visiting this site, drive on Highway #3,  16 km. west from Fernie, and turn left onto the Morrissey Road. The road crosses over the Elk River, then the CPR tracks, where you take the road to the right. Stay on the main road (River Road) where you will come to the Morrissey Creek bridge. Just before the bridge, a road to the right (the TransCanada Great Trail) leads down towards the Elk River. Stay to the left all the way down the road,  as there are many rights, until you reach a yellow gate at the CPR tracks. Park here and walk down the tracks a short distance to your right (north), where you will come into a large opening that is the hydro transmission powerline right of way. To your left, towards the Elk River, and through a cattle gate (close after passing through), you will begin to notice enormous cedar stumps, and dark forests lining either side of the right of way clearing. The “Jeffy Dougy” fir is located in the forest on the left. If you follow a small drainage channel upstream, keeping your eyes up, the top of this gnarly “flowertop” tree can be seen above the canopy.","Tree is the lone interior Douglas-fir observed in this small protected stand of western redcedar, hemlock, black cottonwood, and Englemann spruce. Definitely predates the surrounding trees. Located on the Elk River floodplain. ",Terry Nelson,,,,Jeff Hamilton,1
