1. km 0.0 - start at the Port Renfrew Community Center/Fire
Station and drive down Deering Rd 0.2 km
2. km 0.2 - continue over single lane bridge 1.1 km
3. km 1.4 - turn right at fork and continue for 1.4 km
4. km 2.7 - cross Deering Bridge and turn left onto the Gordon River Main (right goes to Lake Cowichan)
5. Stay on the mostly-paved Gordon River Main and after
approximately 5 km it will become gravel and you
will hit a “Y” where you go LEFT and cross a high bridge
over the beautiful Gordon River.
6. After crossing the bridge keep on the Gordon River Main
for about 1.5 km, staying to the RIGHT at the next “Y”.
7. Shortly after you will cross a small bridge over a creek
(Baird Creek). This is the Avatar Grove, the newly popular old-growth forest hiking area!
8. Continue past the Avatar Grove on the Gordon River Main
for approximately 4.5 km and take your FIRST RIGHT onto
Edinburgh Main road. (Note: it’s a smaller looking road)
9. You will soon cross over a bridge above a very tall canyon
on the Gordon River. *Note: From here on 4x4 vehicles with
good clearance are recommended!
10. Follow the rough road as it veers uphill and then right. Continue
on the main road for approximately 5 minutes.
11. A giant clearcut from 2012 will appear on your right hand
side. In that clearcut you will see two big Douglas-firs left
standing - the second one is Big Lonely Doug.
*NOTE: The hike into Big Lonely Doug is through a difficult
clearcut and should ONLY be attempted by those with good
balance.","The tree stands alone in a clearcut from 2012 and is hard to miss. It has a straight trunk, a broken top, and still has most of it's branches but did recently lose one of it's biggest in a wind storm.

bends East and becomes very coarse. It is advised that one parks in a safe location and walks to the Bumblebee

*Alternatively the Hummingbird and adjacent forest stands can be reached by crossing one of the numerous log-jams
on the Klanawa River East Fork. Park on Newstead Main , and find a log-jam that you can cross safely ( 48.799488,
-124.817626 ) or ( 48.802287, -124.808875 ) for example. Be sensible, do not attempt when the river is flowing high,
and no I am not responsible if your shoe soles are slippery and your iphone goes for a swim ;) Keep your electronics
safe in a ziplock or wet bag. Personally, we prefer using Newstead Main, the road is in better condition and it is a
more straightforward route.

Lake. Arrive at a signposted split between Bamfield and Nitinat and head left towards Nitinat. Driving past the head
of the Lake, you eventually enter the Nitinat River Valley. At the entrance of Nitinat River Ecological Preserve
(Eastern Portion 48.901189, -124.545689 ) you will encounter old-growth Douglas fir forest and some roadside
CMT’s. Have a look at the impressive Nitinat Fir (just below the road, 48.893787, -124.556285 ).
It is also worth checking out the canyon section of the Nitinat river ( 48.895723, -124.558131 ).
A couple of hundred meters past the turnoff for Granite Main, find a safe place to park. On foot, follow an old spur on
the north side of the road ( 48.876268, -124.587473 ) briefly. When the spur becomes overgrown, head left
( 48.878611, -124.585422 ) through the bush. Heading slightly downhill, start contouring to your right along the hillside
until you encounter an impressive stand of Fir and Hemlock on the slope above the river. Here you will encounter the
Cauliflower Mushroom Fir. Follow the lower slope around a corner (northward and upstream) for 50m or so, staying
above the dense brush along the river edge. Once you can easily cross onto the river flats, find your way to the river
edge and safely fjord across the river, just above the bend. You should be able to see a large spruce and you may be
able to see 3PP’s double leaders a little further back from the shore. The tree is located on the flats about 60m from
shore amongst sword ferns.
Please be advised that this is an ACTIVE logging area, follow suitably safe driving techniques and be vigilant and
courteous to other road users. It is advised to only visit this area on weekends when logging activities are minimal.
This is a remote region without cellular reception so plan your trip accordingly. Input your coordinates before you
leave home. In general the gravel road driving is reasonable for most vehicles, but fill your tank and definitely bring a
full sized spare tire along for this trip. There are some basic amenities available in the Village of Nitinat. Only cross
the river when the flow is low, it is recommended to have your electronics in watertight bags and please be careful.","Gradually tapering and with a distinctive burl, the trunk splits into two healthy looking upward facing
leaders at approximately the 40m mark.
Located on a flat and sandy riparian floodplain, 3PP is a fine Douglas fir standing amidst Bigleaf
Maple, Hemlock and Sitka spruce about 60m from the bank of the Nitinat River.
This floodplain is part of a series of high quality, intact riverside patches of old growth standing
between the Eastern and Western portions of the Nitinat River Ecological Reserves. Sitka Spruce begin to
Reach full potential in the floodplains and Douglas fir become less abundant at river level. Here and across
the river in Macoola Grove, one will find the Red Listed Tooth- leaved Monkey flowers and Blue Listed
Scouler’s corydalis carpeting the floor during the late spring and summer.

This tree is on the edge of the next clearing you arrive at.","This is an incredibly impressive Sitka spruce tree with a gigantic columnar trunk that towers into the sky. The sheer volume is staggering. The tree has a broken top but seems to be healthy otherwise. The forest for the most part around it was logged in 2012, exposing one side to the elements. Other giants exist nearby. Certainly not a cheater tree, this one earns all it's wow factor on honest terms. A must see!!

It's huge, riveted trunk looks like the chest of a humpback whale. A number of large limbs then burst skyward, creating healthy and bushy crown. Unfortunately, however, like Big Lonely Doug, it stands alone in a clearcut from 2019. It's likely that its health will suffer now that the forest is gone around it. After surviving for many, many centuries, only time will tell if it will make it to the end of the next one.
