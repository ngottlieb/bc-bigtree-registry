Travel south 27km on the Nimpkish Main past the Vernon Camp turnoff continuing on the Nimpkish Main until you reach the next left which is the Sutton Road turnoff. Go aproximately 1km on the Sutton Main until you will see the top of the tree above the advanced regen on the south low side of the road.,"Tree is showing sings of crown die back due to extreme age. It is growing on flat ground on high bench flood plain above the Nimpkish River near the junction of Sutton Creek and the Kla-anch wetlands. The area has high Elk useage.  The stand is very unique upper valley, CWHmm1 Amabilis dominant stand with multiple Amabalis well over 65m in height and we believed at least 2 may be taller than this nomination, but it is difficult to get the height of the others due to the heavy understory and brush.

The tallest tree previously measured adjacent to these, but now logged, was 248 ft tall. Because of this previously biggest trees loss, Chris Bowden-Green approached John Deal of Canfor to protect the remaining large Balsam within a proposed Elk Winter Range, due to its uniqueness as one of the last remaining old growth valley bottom Amabalis stands.

Edinburgh Main road. (Note: it’s a smaller looking road)
9. You will soon cross over a bridge above a very tall canyon
on the Gordon River. *Note: From here on 4x4 vehicles with
good clearance are recommended!
10. Follow the rough road as it veers uphill and then right. Continue
on the main road for approximately 5 minutes.
11. A giant clearcut from 2012 will appear on your right hand
side. In that clearcut you will see two big Douglas-firs left
standing - the second one is Big Lonely Doug.
*NOTE: The hike into Big Lonely Doug is through a difficult
clearcut and should ONLY be attempted by those with good
balance.","The tree stands alone in a clearcut from 2012 and is hard to miss. It has a straight trunk, a broken top, and still has most of it's branches but did recently lose one of it's biggest in a wind storm.

Carmanah Main. A visit to the waterfalls on the Little Nitinat Falls is recommended for a quick break (unmarked pull

Follow Carmanah Main until a bridge on your left crosses the Little Nitinat River onto Flora Main ( 48.8994754,

Follow Flora until you reach Upper Klanawa Main ( 48.861963, -124.739748 ) and turn left.

K-265, up a steep pitch and around a tight bend ( 48.8267934, -124.7812745 ). After some time, along the South side
of K-265 there are a couple of small lakes accessed via a short spur (approx 48.8274633, -1248130282 ), where one
can visit the Fairy Bell Cedar at Dorothy Lake (at the head of the second lake, 48.825688, -124.822826 ).
Coming to another T-Intersection ( 48.8307925, -124.8372049 ), turn left and continue straight past another
intersection and follow it until you reach the spruce flats and recently logged areas at the bottom of the valley (approx
48.7969942, -124.8668236 ). This is where the Main and East Forks of the Klanawa River meet. This new road
bends East and becomes very coarse. It is advised that one parks in a safe location and walks to the Bumblebee
Tree from the road (starting at 48.801119, -124.832387 ).
*Alternatively the Hummingbird and adjacent forest stands can be reached by crossing one of the numerous log-jams
on the Klanawa River East Fork. Park on Newstead Main , and find a log-jam that you can cross safely ( 48.799488,
-124.817626 ) or ( 48.802287, -124.808875 ) for example. Be sensible, do not attempt when the river is flowing high,
and no I am not responsible if your shoe soles are slippery and your iphone goes for a swim ;) Keep your electronics
safe in a ziplock or wet bag. Personally, we prefer using Newstead Main, the road is in better condition and it is a
more straightforward route.
Please be advised that this is an ACTIVE logging area, follow suitably safe driving techniques and be vigilant and
courteous to other road users. It is advised to only visit this area on weekends when logging activities are minimal.
This is a remote area without cellular reception so plan your trip accordingly. Input your coordinates before you leave

Lake. Arrive at a signposted split between Bamfield and Nitinat and head left towards Nitinat. Driving past the head
of the Lake, you eventually enter the Nitinat River Valley. At the entrance of Nitinat River Ecological Preserve
(Eastern Portion 48.901189, -124.545689 ) you will encounter old-growth Douglas fir forest and some roadside
CMT’s. Have a look at the impressive Nitinat Fir (just below the road, 48.893787, -124.556285 ).
It is also worth checking out the canyon section of the Nitinat river ( 48.895723, -124.558131 ).
A couple of hundred meters past the turnoff for Granite Main, find a safe place to park. On foot, follow an old spur on
the north side of the road ( 48.876268, -124.587473 ) briefly. When the spur becomes overgrown, head left
( 48.878611, -124.585422 ) through the bush. Heading slightly downhill, start contouring to your right along the hillside
until you encounter an impressive stand of Fir and Hemlock on the slope above the river. Here you will encounter the
Cauliflower Mushroom Fir. Follow the lower slope around a corner (northward and upstream) for 50m or so, staying
above the dense brush along the river edge. Once you can easily cross onto the river flats, find your way to the river
edge and safely fjord across the river, just above the bend. You should be able to see a large spruce and you may be
able to see 3PP’s double leaders a little further back from the shore. The tree is located on the flats about 60m from
shore amongst sword ferns.
Please be advised that this is an ACTIVE logging area, follow suitably safe driving techniques and be vigilant and
courteous to other road users. It is advised to only visit this area on weekends when logging activities are minimal.
This is a remote region without cellular reception so plan your trip accordingly. Input your coordinates before you
leave home. In general the gravel road driving is reasonable for most vehicles, but fill your tank and definitely bring a
full sized spare tire along for this trip. There are some basic amenities available in the Village of Nitinat. Only cross
the river when the flow is low, it is recommended to have your electronics in watertight bags and please be careful.","Gradually tapering and with a distinctive burl, the trunk splits into two healthy looking upward facing
leaders at approximately the 40m mark.
Located on a flat and sandy riparian floodplain, 3PP is a fine Douglas fir standing amidst Bigleaf
Maple, Hemlock and Sitka spruce about 60m from the bank of the Nitinat River.
This floodplain is part of a series of high quality, intact riverside patches of old growth standing
between the Eastern and Western portions of the Nitinat River Ecological Reserves. Sitka Spruce begin to
Reach full potential in the floodplains and Douglas fir become less abundant at river level. Here and across
the river in Macoola Grove, one will find the Red Listed Tooth- leaved Monkey flowers and Blue Listed
Scouler’s corydalis carpeting the floor during the late spring and summer.

If able to drive to the lodge, drive the 8 km through spectacular old growth cedar forest, then follow the Fir Trail and look for the large western larch on the crest. From this vantage point, peering down into the deep gully this very stately tree is visible, but very difficult to access. Alternatively, book yourself a cat skiing adventure, and ask to be taken to Hunter Bowl, where the snowcat pick up zone is located very close to the tree.","This remarkable tree stands alone in an alder slide path, where evidence of seepage on the adjacent southerly facing slope was observed, as there was no snow on this slope. There are many very large trees on the crest above this Engelmann spruce, including western larch, Douglas fir, and some other mature spruce.
The tree appears to be in good health, as a 400 mm increment bore core sample was extracted with no signs of internal decay. The tree supports a healthy crown, and given its sheltered location, will hopefully extend its longevity for a while yet. Age is estimated at 550 years old.
Summer access would be very difficult as a waterfall is directly below, an alder choked gully above, and very thick vegetation surrounding the tree.

From there head south off trail towards the unnamed creek. Tree is on the north side of this creek.,"This tree is in excellent health, and is well situated in a secondgrowth stand alongside a seasonal creek bed, just outside the boundaries of an Old Growth Management Area. Judging by the recovery of the surrounding forest, I would expect that soil conditions are quite good. Nearby, there are a couple more yews that may reach similar size in the next several decades. Conditions are ideal for future growth, as soils are good and it is sheltered from winds by a small rock outcropping and a vigorous forest canopy.

Backtracking, I found where I missed the turn-off at the junction. The rough gravel road rises steeply from the Salmon River valley, where at the 17 km marker a junction where the road goes down to a bridge crossing the White River, is not the right direction, stay left on the Victoria Main for a further 6 km, where the Park Boundary sign is your first indication that you are getting close to your destination. A short distance further, and an obscure (facing in the wrong direction of travel) sign directs you towards a short trail that leads you through the big Douglas-fir trees towards the river.

The tree is within the protected area of the White River Provincial Park, which is a narrow linear strip of preserved old-growth, with extensive harvesting visual all around it.

The old road is easily missed by those driving on Highway 16, because of the steep drop it takes off the highway.

A short distance after this, there is a second fork in the road, where an ATV trail continues to the right and the left side appears less worn-in. At this second fork, follow the left (less worn-in) side. After a minute or so, take the trail on the left leading away from the old road and into the forest (it should be flagged).

Unlike most other trees, its trunk gets wider going upwards, culminating in a sprawling fortress-like crown of wooden spires akin to a massive wooden wall of an ancient castle. This giant could possibly have the largest or near largest wood volume of any tree in Canada for about the first 50 ft of its trunk - the part you see from the ground.

The trail is accessed by an old road on the south side of Highway 16, 1/2km before the Goat River bridge and rest area. The old road is easily missed by those driving on Highway 16, because of the steep drop it takes off the highway. If you do not have a 4-WD vehicle, it is best to park at the Goat River rest area and walk west on the south side of Highway 16 to spot the rough access road. If you drive down the old road, there is a small clearing a short ways down with room to park.The hike initially follows the old road. You will cross a rough wooden bridge over a creek. Shortly afterwards, you will reach a fork in the road where the right side is very overgrown. Take the left fork. A short distance after this, there is a second fork in the road, where an ATV trail continues to the right and the left side appears less worn-in. At this second fork, follow the left (less worn-in) side. After a minute or so, take the trail on the left leading away from the old road and into the forest (it should be flagged). From here, the trail is easy to follow. You will stay on the plateau before crossing a stream and descending towards the canyon.

It was situated in a productive toe slope near a riparian area in a cool and moist site with strong coastal influences. Four increment cores were taken with a haglof borer to determine the age of the tree. The 24 inch increment borer was not long enough to obtain the exact age of the tree. The minimum age of the tree (as determined through tree ring measurements of the four samples) is 459 years (1561-2020). Pith estimates could not be used to estimate the location of the centre of the tree as no ring curvature was present. The absence of ring curvature, DBH of the tree, and calculation of years to reach coring height suggest that this tree is between 600-800 years in age. The tree is estimated to be 20m tall with a basal DBH of 0.9m.",Kira Hoffman,Jodi Axelson,Alana Clason,Mark Parminter,Kira Hoffman,c,1,"<a href=""https://bigtreesreg.sites.olt.ubc.ca/files/2023/03/1112_Pa_Tweedsmuir_KH_1.jpg"" target=""_blank"">1</a>   <a href=""https://bigtreesreg.sites.olt.ubc.ca/files/2023/03/1112_Pa_Tweedsmuir_KH_2.jpg"" target=""_blank"">2</a>   <a href=""https://bigtreesreg.sites.olt.ubc.ca/files/2023/03/1112_Pa_Tweedsmuir_KH_3.jpg"" target=""_blank"">3</a>      ",,,,29,i,NAD 83

Keep right and continue along Lucky FSR for another 1.4km. there will be a deactivated and brushed in spur road on your right. This is the start of teh rough trail up to Block F004C4DT. Hike up the spur for 700m to a very overgorwn junction. Keep to the left and hike a further 450 m. You will come across some yellow flagging that indicates a rough trail up to F004C4DT. The trail heads upslope from the spur road and is heavy going through an advanced plantation for approximately 150m. Once you reach the Old-growth it is easy but steep hiking. From the end of the flagged trail, continue up slope heading directly south for approximately 170m until you reach the upper falling boundary.

From Halfmoon Bay head east towards Trout Lake Road. Head north up Trout Lake Road. Around 5.5km, turn east (right) on Carlson Mainline towards Carlson Lake. At around 1.5km turn east (right) and head up an old, washed out road between 2 cut blocks. Follow this road for about 1.3km until you reach a fork. Take the road on the left that heads north up towards Spipiyus Provincial Park. Stay on this road for about 4.5km before reaching a 4 way. Turn right (east) and consider parking before the next cross ditch between the 2 small lakes. Enter the forest on the other side of this cross ditch. The tree is up on a little raised area with a small slope down to another small lake on the east side of it.","This tree is in excellent condition, other than having lost much of its upper crown quite some time ago. I remain convinced that this region warrants thorough exploration, as we were able to view other trees of similar size in this grove. Not far from this specimen are the remnants of the largest cedar we found, easily over 2.00 metres in diameter, I estimated. It’s not unusual for yellow cedars such as these to be at least 1000 years old, and some are much older. Wildlife values for this area are exceptionally high, and the forest is regularly frequented by elk and black bear.",Steve McKenzie,Mick Bailey,,,Mick Bailey,c,1,"<a href=""https://bigtreesreg.sites.olt.ubc.ca/files/2023/07/1363_Yc_Phoenix_MB_1.jpg"" target=""_blank"">1</a>   <a href=""https://bigtreesreg.sites.olt.ubc.ca/files/2023/07/1363_Yc_Phoenix_MB_2.jpg"" target=""_blank"">2</a>   <a href=""https://bigtreesreg.sites.olt.ubc.ca/files/2023/07/1363_Yc_Phoenix_MB_3.jpg"" target=""_blank"">3</a>   <a href=""https://bigtreesreg.sites.olt.ubc.ca/files/2023/07/1363_Yc_Phoenix_MB_4.jpg"" target=""_blank"">4</a>   ",,33,,14,c,WGS 84
